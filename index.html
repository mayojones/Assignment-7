                <h1 >Stairs to Nowhere</h1>
                <h2>By Bruce Nauman</h2>
                <h3>Article By Vanessa Martinez</h3>

                <p id="text">To all who may seek understanding of The Stairs To Nowhere, one must first consider what, in fact they are. In short The Stairs To Nowhere are a symbolic and functional sculpture located in front of the Academic West Building on Western Washington University’s main campus. The Stairs are actually called “Stadium Piece” by the artist Bruce Nauman and were constructed as a gift to Western from the Virginia Wright Fund. According to the Western Gallery Website the Stairs are meant to “signify the students education about how to communicate and how to perform in a larger environment.”

                    <strong>Who uses the Stairs, if anyone at all?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Perhaps your first inclination is to think only artist are attracted to the Stairs, being that they are a sculpture but in the same way you do not have to be a musician to enjoy music, you do not have to be an artist to partake in art, and yes, even sit on the Stairs. So who uses the stairs then? The answer is simple; students. Students use the Stairs. The Stairs are used to sit, to study, to relax, to listen to music or read a book. Some students even simply perch atop the Stairs to people watch as as the various bodies walk by heading somewhere. The people on the Stairs though are as mixed and diverse as the rest of campus. Not one kind of person sits on the Stairs but rather the intentions of the people on the Stairs is the common theme between them: their desire to relax; to step out of the ongoing flow of college traffic. Everyone on the Stairs is there to slow the pace of a hectic day and that’s the unspoken rule on the Stairs. They are for the overwhelmed introvert, seeking some of their own space; they are for the studious, seeking some outdoor study time. The Stairs are for the thinkers and watchers and listeners, all alike. The Stairs are for you; a student seeking solace.

                    <strong>Why Are They Important?”</strong>“
                    <br>
                    The Stairs serve the purpose of a calm haven in the middle of a clamouring campus. The Stairs are a resting place, a waiting place and an observatory for those who seek their stoney solace. In an interview with a fellow student Conor Workman I gained further insight as to why the stairs are so important in a student’s life here at Western. Conor says “the Stairs are a place where I come to gather my thoughts at the end of a long day. Sometimes I read or listen to music. Just give myself some down time and the Stairs are the perfect place to do it.” Conor, like so many other students here at Western, has found his solace in the Stairs.
